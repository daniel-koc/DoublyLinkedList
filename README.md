# DoublyLinkedList

## Description of the task

Create a C++ program that implements a linked list. The linked list should be a doubly linked list, allowing movement forward and backward. This program should allow you to add and remove nodes from the list. Each node should contain a reference to application data. The program does not have to provide user interaction. Please include units tests for the program.

## Solution

The project consists of the following files:
* DoubleLinkedList.h - The implementation of the list
* DoubleLinkedList.h - The implementation using smart pointers
* main.cpp - The example of use
* gtest_main.cpp - contains the main function for GTest framework
* LinkedListTest.cpp - test cases

For tests the following framework was utilized: https://github.com/google/googletest
